In the financial sector, EU legislation requires financial institutions to disclose a significant amount of data products, transactions and financial results. Moreover, the revised Payment Services Directive marks an important step towards open banking, where innovative payment services can be offered to consumers and businesses on the basis of the access to their bank account data. Going forward, enhancing data sharing would contribute to stimulating innovation as well as achieving other important policy objectives at EU level.

The Commission will set out concrete initiatives on this in its upcoming Digital Finance Strategy in Q3 2020 along the following considerations:

* The Commission will further facilitate access to public disclosures of financial data or supervisory reporting data, currently mandated by law, for example by promoting the use of common pro-competitive technical standards. This would facilitate more efficient processing of such publicly accessible data to the benefit of a number of other policies of public interest, such as enhancing access to finance for European businesses through more integrated capital markets, improving market transparency and supporting sustainable finance in the EU.
* On the basis of recent market developments on open finance, the Commission will continue to ensure full implementation of the revised Payment Services Directive and explore additional steps and initiatives building on this approach.
