A Common European **skills** data space, to reduce the skills mismatches between the education and training system on the one hand and the labour market needs on the other.

The skills of its people are Europeâ€™s strongest asset. In a global race for talent, the European education and training systems and labour markets need to quickly adapt to new and emerging skills needs. This requires high-quality data on qualifications, learning opportunities, jobs and the skill sets of people. Over the past years, the Commission has put in place a range of open standards, reference frameworks and semantic assets to increase data quality and interoperability70. As announced in the Digital Education Action Plan71, the Commission also developed the Europass Digital Credentials framework to issue credentials to learners in a secure and interoperable digital format.

The Commission will:

* Support Member States in the development of digital credential transformation plans and in the preparation of re-usable data-sets of qualifications and learning opportunities (2020-2022);  
* Establish a governance model for the on-going management of the Europass Digital Credentials Framework in close cooperation with Member States and key stakeholders (by 2022).
