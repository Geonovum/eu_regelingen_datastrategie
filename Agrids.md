## Agriculture data space

A Common European **agriculture** data space, to enhance the sustainability performance and competitiveness of the agricultural sector through the processing and analysis of production and other data, allowing for precise and tailored application of production approaches at farm level.
 
Data is one key element to enhance the sustainability performance and competitiveness of the agricultural sector. Processing and analysing production data, especially in combination with other data on the supply chain and other types of data, such as earth observation or meteorological data, allows for precise and tailored application of production approaches at farm level. A code of conduct for sharing of agricultural data by contractual agreement was developed in 2018 by EU stakeholders, involving – among others – the farming as well as the machinery sector.

A common data space for agricultural data based on existing approaches towards data sharing could lead to a neutral platform for sharing and pooling agricultural data, including both private and public data. This could support the emergence of an innovative data-driven ecosystem based on fair contractual relations as well as strengthen the capacities for monitoring and implementing common policies and reducing administrative burden for  

government and beneficiaries. In 2019, Member States have joined forces and signed a declaration of cooperation ‘A smart and sustainable digital future for European agriculture and rural areas’67, which recognises the potential of digital technologies for the agricultural sector and rural areas and supports the setting up of data spaces.

The Commission will:

* Take stock with Member States and stakeholder organisations of experiences gained with the stakeholder code of conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, also on the basis of the current market for digital farm solutions and their requirements in terms of data availability and use (Q3/Q4 2020).

* Take stock of agricultural data spaces in current use, including funded under the Horizon 2020 programme, with stakeholders and Member State organisations and take decision on an EU approach (Q4 2020/Q1 2021).
