## Industrial and manufacturing data space

Common European **industrial** (manufacturing) data space, to support the competitiveness and performance of the EU’s industry, allowing to capture the potential value of use of non-personal data in manufacturing (estimated at € 1,5 trillion by 2027). 

Europe has a strong industrial base, and manufacturing in particular is an area where the generation of and use of data can make a significant difference to the performance and competitiveness of European industry. A 2018 study estimated the potential value of use of non-personal data in manufacturing at € 1,5 trillion by 202756.

In order to unleash this potential, the Commission will:

* Address issues related to the usage rights on co-generated industrial data (IoT data created in industrial settings), as part of a wider Data Act (Q4 2021).
    
* Gather key players from the manufacturing sector to agree – in a manner compliant with competition rules as well as principles of fair contracts – the conditions under which they would be ready to share their data and how to further boost data generation, notably via smart connected products (Q2 2020 onwards). Where data generated by individuals are concerned, their interests should be fully taken into account in such a process and compliance with data protection rules must be ensured.
