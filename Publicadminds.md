## Public Administration data space
Common European data spaces for **public administration**, to improve transparency and accountability of public spending and spending quality, fighting corruption, both at EU and national level, and to address law enforcement needs and support the effective application of EU law and enable innovative ‘gov tech’, ‘reg tech’ and ‘legal tech’ applications supporting practitioners as well as other services of public interest


Public administrations are big producers and also users of data in different areas. The data spaces for public administrations will reflect this. Actions in this areas will focus on law and public procurement data and other areas of public interest such as data use for improving law enforcement in the EU in line with EU law, including the principle of proportionality and data protection rules.

Public procurement data are essential to improve transparency and accountability of public spending, fighting corruption and improving spending quality. Public procurement data is spread over several systems in the Member States, made available in different formats and is not easily possible to use for policy purposes in real-time. In many cases, the data quality needs to be improved.

Similarly, seamless access to and easy reuse of EU and Member State legislation, jurisprudence as well as information on e-justice services is critical not only for the effective application of EU law but also enables innovative ‘legal tech’ applications supporting practitioners (judges, public officials, corporate counsel and lawyers in private practice).

The Commission will:

* Elaborate a data initiative for public procurement data covering both the EU dimension (EU datasets, such as TED68) and the national ones (Q4 2020). It will be complemented by a procurement data governance framework (Q2 2021);
* Issue guidance on common standards as well as interoperable frameworks for legal information69 held at European and national level, in close cooperation with Member States (Q1 2021);
* work with Member States to ensure that data sources related to the implementation of the EU budget are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).
