## Energy data space

A Common European **energy** data space, to promote a stronger availability and cross-sector sharing of data, in a customer-centric, secure and trustworthy manner, as this would facilitate innovative solutions and support the decarbonisation of the energy system

In the energy sector, several Directives establish customer access to and portability of their meter and energy consumption data on a transparent, non-discriminatory basis and in compliance with data protection law. 
The specific governance frameworks are to be defined at the national level. 
Legislation also introduced data-sharing obligations for electricity network operators. 
Regarding cybersecurity, work is ongoing to address energy-specific challenges, notably: real-time requirements, cascading effects and the mix of legacy technologies with smart/state-of-the-art technology .

The availability and cross-sector sharing of data, in a secure and trustworthy manner can facilitate innovative solutions and support the decarbonisation of the energy system. The Commission will address these issues _as part of the smart sector integration strategy_ to be adopted in the second quarter of this year (2020) as announced in the Communication on the European Green Deal.

The Commission will:

* Adopt implementing act(s)66 setting out the interoperability requirements and non- discriminatory and transparent procedures for access to data, building on existing national practices on the basis of the Electricity Directive 2019/944 (2021/2022).
    
* Consider actions for improving the interoperability in smart buildings and products, with a view to improve their energy efficiency, optimise local consumption and broaden the integration of renewable energy sources (Q4 2020).
